# Alzheimer-Udacity
This is the second project in fulfilment of the **AI for Healthcare** *Udacity Nanodegree*. The project uses brain MRI image stack to locate the hippocampus and compute its volume which is a prognostic measure for Alzheimerâ€™s progression. The following Background and project description are excerpts of *Udacity* project space.

## Backround
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in impaired neuronal (brain cell) function and eventually, cell death. AD is the most common cause of dementia. Clinically, it is characterized by memory loss, inability to learn new material, loss of language function, and other manifestations.
For patients exhibiting early symptoms, quantifying disease progression over time can help direct therapy and disease management.
A radiological study via MRI exam is currently one of the most advanced methods to quantify the disease. In particular, the measurement of hippocampal volume has proven useful to diagnose and track progression in several brain disorders, most notably in AD. Studies have shown a reduced volume of the hippocampus in patients with AD.
The hippocampus is a critical structure of the human brain (and the brain of other vertebrates) that plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. In other words, the hippocampus is thought to be responsible for memory and learning

Humans have two hippocampi, one in each hemisphere of the brain. They are located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain. According to [Nobis et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219302542), the volume of hippocampus varies in a population, depending on various parameters, within certain boundaries, and it is possible to identify a "normal" range taking into account age, sex and brain hemisphere.

## Objective
An end-to-end AI system is built comprised of a machine learning algorithm that integrates into a clinical-grade viewer and automatically measures hippocampal volumes of new patients.
U-Net architecture is used to train the model on the MRI images and the corresponding hippocampus segments in NIFTI format. Finally, the model is integrated into a working clinical PACS such that it runs on every incoming study and produces a report with volume measurements. Following packages are used:
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html)
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
* [tensorboard](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboard/)

Following software products were provided by *Udacity Workspace* in the 3rd section of the project for emulating the clinical network:
*	[Orthanc server](https://www.orthanc-server.com/download.php) for PACS emulation
*	[OHIF zero-footprint web viewer](https://docs.ohif.org/development/getting-started.html) for viewing images
*	[DCMTK tools](https://dcmtk.org/) for testing and emulating a modality

## Dataset
Hippocampus dataset are obtained from the [Medical Decathlon competition](http://medicaldecathlon.com/). Dataset consists of NIFTI files each of which represents a volume and the corresponding segmentation mask. The original images are T2 MRI scans of the full brain, however, only the region of interest (hippocampus) is cropped and studied. This allows for simpler, faster training of the model.

## Project Phases
### Phase 1: EDA & Data Cleanup
As mentioned earlier only the hippocampus region is fed to the model. The [EDA](Section1/EDA.ipynb) file analyses the dataset of images and labels (i.e. segments). Following is the snapshot of one dataset showing the image slices next the corresponding segment.

Using nibabel package, useful information such as NIFTI metadata, unit of measurement, sagittal and coronal plane, etc are extracted. The dataset is later inspected for any irregularities in file length, slice-label correspondence, ect. The curated dataset is exported for the next phase of the project, Section 2.
