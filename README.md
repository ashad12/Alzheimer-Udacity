# Alzheimer-Udacity
This is the second project in fulfilment of the **AI for Healthcare** *Udacity Nanodegree*. The project uses brain MRI image stack to locate the hippocampus and compute its volume which is a prognostic measure for Alzheimerâ€™s progression. The following Background and project description are excerpts of *Udacity* project space.

## Backround
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in impaired neuronal (brain cell) function and eventually, cell death. AD is the most common cause of dementia. Clinically, it is characterized by memory loss, inability to learn new material, loss of language function, and other manifestations.
For patients exhibiting early symptoms, quantifying disease progression over time can help direct therapy and disease management.
A radiological study via MRI exam is currently one of the most advanced methods to quantify the disease. In particular, the measurement of hippocampal volume has proven useful to diagnose and track progression in several brain disorders, most notably in AD. Studies have shown a reduced volume of the hippocampus in patients with AD.
The hippocampus is a critical structure of the human brain (and the brain of other vertebrates) that plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory. In other words, the hippocampus is thought to be responsible for memory and learning

Humans have two hippocampi, one in each hemisphere of the brain. They are located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain. According to [Nobis et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219302542), the volume of hippocampus varies in a population, depending on various parameters, within certain boundaries, and it is possible to identify a "normal" range taking into account age, sex and brain hemisphere.
